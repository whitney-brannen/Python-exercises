    "1. The average cost of tuition in the US is **19,020** a year. (https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/average-cost-of-college/)\n",

    "5. The 75th percentile of all SAT scores taken by highschool students is **1200**, which is typically considered acceptable for applying for most colleges. (https://www.bestcolleges.com/blog/what-is-a-good-sat-score/)\n",
    "- I will be looking at schools with an average SAT score of `1100 or higher`. While colleges put a lot of weight into standardized test scores, it often does not reflect the actual classroom success of a student."

The colleges in part 1 are what we know as the most prestigious, well- known schools, but in reality, these school are not a possiblity for the majority of students in the United States.  Alternatively, the results of the schools in part 2 are definitly a great possibility for the average student in the United States.

Not surprisingly, University of Pennsylvania (matches prestigious qualifications of part 1) is the highest earning program when ranked alongside the others.  In contrast, the other prestigious university, Columbia University in the City of New York, actually falls second to last when ranked against other programs. I was surprised to see how many of these programs actually fell into my practical rankings from part 2, where the school is reasonable and affordable, but also compares to (or surpasses) those most prestigious from part 1.  This provides some evidence that you can still be very successful with a degree from a \"lower ranking\" school as you can from the most prestigious in the US."

    "<font color = red> As expected, WCU does not fall in the rankings from part 1, but surpisingly does not also meet the rankings of part 2.  When observing this, I notice that all of the values meet the requirements, except for the median earnings 10 years after enrollment.  There could be many reasons for this, one being that WCU is very well known for its teaching/ education programs, and teachers (particularly in the state of NC) make relatively low salaries, which could bring this value down.  Another reason could also be that demographically, most students at WCU are from NC or closely surrounding states, and likely stay in these areas for employment.  Many of these areas have lower cost of living than much of the United States, which may also influence the salary data.  When thinking about this topic, it does seem like most all of the colleges meeting my rankings for part 2 are located in the North East or West/ North West, where cost of living is known to be higher.  This is likely why they met the requirements for salary while many others (ex. from the midwest or south) did not.  To properly expand on these findings, it would be beneficial to create a ratio column of cost of living : median salary.  This would then provide more accurate data on how \"well off\" graduates from each program/ school are.  The main flaw in this method is that many graduates move to different locations, which would again skew the data."
